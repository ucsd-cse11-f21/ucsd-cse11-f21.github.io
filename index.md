# Accelerated Intro to Programming (UCSD CSE 11)
## Fall 2021

Hi! This page is a placeholder for now, addressing some frequently asked
questions we get about CSE11. We may have linked you to this page in response
to an email. Feel free to follow up with jpolitz@eng.ucsd.edu with further
questions about the course, unless it's explicitly addressed below.

**I have a question about enrollments and the waitlist.**

Please contact [CSE student
affairs](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate/advising/cse-student-affairs-office-hours),
who can give the best advice and information about the enrollment process. They
are friendly and helpful and know much more about timing and any updates you
will see through the registration system.

There is some useful advice at [Enrolling in CSE
Courses](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/courses/enrolling-cse-courses) that
likely summarizes a lot of what they would tell you to get you started.

**Will the course be in person or remote?**

Right now we're expecting to run CSE11 in person in lecture halls and computer
labs, per [campus
announcements](https://adminrecords.ucsd.edu/Notices/2021/2021-4-5-3.html?_ga=2.68189841.1679226630.1617638163-1407889900.1563300100).
We'll update here if that changes; right now we're not positive if there will
be an official hybrid option.

**Is attendance required?**

Regardless of if we have a remote option, we do make use of the fact that class
is *synchronous*, and overall participation and engagement is typically a part
of CSE11 grades. So you should not, for example, enroll in another class that
has a time conflict with CSE11, including discussion sections.

Typically we have policies that make it so attendance isn't strictly required
for every class session, so if you might miss a few lectures and discussions
here and there, don't stress about that.  

As an exception to the class being synchronous, the **final exam** will have an
asynchronous format. Students will not be required to take the final exam
during the scheduled block, and there will be some flexibility on when it is
completed the day of the exam (but not necessarily flexibility to take it on
other days).

**What's the course material like?**

You can see a [previous version of the
course](https://ucsd-cse11-s20.github.io/), which will give you a sense. This
offering will not be identical, but will be similar.

**I'm not sure if I should take CSE11 or CSE8A.**

We endorse the [CSE course placement
advice](https://cse.ucsd.edu/index.php/undergraduate/courses/cse-course-placement-advice).
Also feel free to message jpolitz@eng.ucsd.edu if you're not sure.

**What if I have enrolled in CSE11 but won't be able to be in La Jolla for most
or all of Fall 2021?**

Please contact jpolitz@eng.ucsd.edu.
