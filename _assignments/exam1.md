This page details a take-home exam that you will complete over the next few
days. You canâ€™t communicate with anyone about the content of the assignment
until you receive your grade. The course staff will not give debugging advice or
answer questions about the problems. If you have technical trouble creating a
screencast (detailed below) feel free to reach out for assistance.

Do not use any online service other than course resources to ask questions about
the assignment. Do not search for, solicit, or use complete solutions to the
problems that you find elsewhere for the exam. These are all violations of

You can make use of any course notes, online resources about Java and its
libraries, Java tools, and so on to complete the exam.
