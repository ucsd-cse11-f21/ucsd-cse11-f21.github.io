## Problem Session 1 â€“ Introduction

_{{ page.released-on }}_

Welcome to the page for the first problem session! Each problem session will
come with a page like this that summarizes the videos you should watch and
readings you should complete **beforehand**, along with any handouts for the day
and code examples, notes, and recordings from the problem solving session.

Before the first lecture, there are no videos to watch. You should familiarize
yourself with the [syllabus](../syllabus.html).

The handout for the first day has a few questions for us to use as icebreakers
and to start talking about programming. You can access [the PDF
directly](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19JrgyrjWEqPoFX7tgIdk02Y6kngAH6D7/preview)
on Google Drive to download it.
