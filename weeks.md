<h3>Schedule</h3>

The schedule below outlines topics, due dates, and links to assignments. In a
typical week, by 5pm Monday before class all due dates, readings, and notable
events in the course until the following week will be posted here. So if you
check the schedule at the beginning of the week, you'll know when all reading
quizzes, programming assignments, etc. will be due. We will often have the
schedule confirmed more than a week out, but we'll strive to be up to date with
the current week.
