## Asking Questions and Getting Help

There are 25 staff members (instructor, TAs, and tutors) to help with your
learning, and a few different ways to get in touch and ask for help.

## Message Board Questions

You can post questions on our Piazza message board at any time:
[piazza.com/ucsd/fall2021/cse11_fa21/home](piazza.com/ucsd/fall2021/cse11_fa21/home)

The message board is a good place for questions about something that was
confusing in class, in videos, in the book, or generally about course content.
It's not always the best place for help with programming details on your
assignments (remote or in-person lab hours are better for that). If you do post
for help with a programming assignment, we ask that you use good judgment in how
much code you share ‚Äì sharing too much as part of your question could harm
others' learning if they aren't expecting to see parts of a solution. 

Feel free to engage with your classmates and help answer their questions. Always
be polite and assume the best intentions. Always assume that the person you're
talking to is asking an honest question, and don't assume they ‚Äúshould know‚Äù
something; if they seem to not know something from the course, reminding them
with a link to where it was taught can be useful (instead of saying something
like ‚Äúthat was already covered‚Äù). Try to guide your classmates to useful
conclusions on their own rather than solving their problems for them. Using
emoji can always help with a positive and friendly vibe üôÇ

During the times where we have take-home programming exams, Piazza will not
allow posting public to the class.

## Meeting with Staff

There are two main reasons to come see the staff in CSE11.

1. You need help on an assignment, reviewing past work, or understanding
something from the course material.
2. An assignment requires or allows you to see a staff member to review your
work after you make a submission.

There are two ways to get general help, remotely or in the labs. Checking off
assignment work can _only_ be done remotely over Zoom.

### Remote Help

To get help *remotely*, you can join this Zoom room:
[https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/95758500952](https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/95758500952)

Once in the waiting room, _also_ create a ticket on
[https://autograder.ucsd.edu](https://autograder.ucsd.edu) and use either the
‚ÄúRemote Help‚Äù or ‚ÄúRemote Check-off‚Äù tag when you create the ticket. (If you
don't make the ticket, we'll still try to get to you, but it will probably take
a little longer unless there's no one in the queue.)

A staff member will admit you in queue order and join you in a one-on-one
breakout room.

Depending on how many students are present, it may take a few minutes for the
staff member to admit the next student, so please be patient!

If you see ‚Äúwaiting for the host to start the meeting‚Äù it means that no one is
on right now. Check the calendar below (also on the [calendar](/calendar.html)
page) to make sure there are lab hours currently and message us on Piazza if
someone is supposed to be there and no one is there.

### In-person Help

To get help *in-person*, you can file a ticket on
[https://autograder.ucsd.edu](https://autograder.ucsd.edu) from the labs in the
CSE building.

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d13402.475705970317!2d-117.2335235!3d32.8818006!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0xa7dc3be7597d4d47!2sComputer%20Science%20and%20Engineering%20Building!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1632176178912!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="600" height="450" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy"></iframe>

The labs are on the lowest level of the building; the hallway outside the labs
looks like this:

<img src="./basement.jpg" width="100%">

Use a seat in lab B260 if it is available, that's where our staff will be
centered. You will get updates in autograder about your ticket once you file it.
Check on this calendar for availability (also available on the general calendar
page):

<iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_2477vkfs96nrh3u1ec4rttt34o%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles" style="border: 0" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

You don't have to go to the labs just for help ‚Äì you're also welcome just to go
there to work any time!

### Instructor Office Hours

‚ÄúOffice hours‚Äù should maybe be called ‚Äústudent hours‚Äù ‚Äì they are times where
we are available in our office (physically or virtually) **for you**. You can
come to instructor office hours with any kind of questions about the course, or
even about the next course, or about catching up if you feel you've fallen
behind, or something you wanted to know more about from lecture, and more. You
can also ask us programming questions in office hours, just like you would in
help hours with the tutors. In order to focus our time on student questions,
instructors **won't** check off work during instructor office hours; you have to
go to the designated remote hours for those.

## FAQs

**Do I have to participate if I'm on the waitlist?**

Yes, you're responsible for everything as if you're a normally-enrolled student
while you're on the waitlist, including any submission deadlines, and your work
will be graded as usual.

**I have a question about enrollments and the waitlist.**

Please contact [CSE student
affairs](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate/advising/cse-student-affairs-office-hours),
who can give the best advice and information about the enrollment process. They
are friendly and helpful and know much more about timing and any updates you
will see through the registration system.

There is some useful advice at [Enrolling in CSE
Courses](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/courses/enrolling-cse-courses) that
likely summarizes a lot of what they would tell you to get you started.

**Will the course be in-person or remote? Is attendance required?**

This policy is subject to change given the uncertainty of university, local,
national, and global policy.

There are several options for attending lectures and getting participation
credit in this course. All of them require **synchronous** participation and
discussion with your classmates. Both in-person and remote options are
available. By **synchronous** we mean that you need to be available during the
scheduled time.

The content of the course is primarily delivered through an online textbook and
through pre-recorded videos from the instructors. The synchronous sessions are
for problem-solving with your classmates and Q&A with the instructional team.
In each session, you will work in pairs or small groups on problems that we
provide and we will go over them as a group.

**In-person sessions** will be led during the normally-scheduled lecture times in the normally-scheduled
rooms, led by the instructors. These sessions will be recorded but
will not be available remotely while they are ongoing.

**Remote sessions** include all of the normally scheduled discussion sections for the
course, which are on the same days as in-person lectures, and at a variety of
times.


For credit you **must** attend a section on each day (Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday), but you can attend any section or different sections across the days,
with some small number of allowed absences.

As an exception to the class being synchronous, the **final exam** will have an
asynchronous format. Students will not be required to take the final exam
during the scheduled block, and there will be some flexibility on when it is
completed the day of the exam (but not necessarily flexibility to take it on
other days).

**What's the course material like?**

You can see a [previous version of the
course](https://ucsd-cse11-s20.github.io/), which will give you a sense. This
offering will not be identical, but will be similar.

There is no required textbook for you to purchase for the course. The course uses a combination of online resources and notes from the instructors.

**I'm not sure if I should take CSE11 or CSE8A.**

We endorse the [CSE course placement
advice](https://cse.ucsd.edu/index.php/undergraduate/courses/cse-course-placement-advice).
Also feel free to message jpolitz@eng.ucsd.edu if you're not sure.

**Can I audit the course?**

You can use all the public resources on this website, and if you're a UCSD
community member, you can view all the podcasts for the problem sessions at
[https://podcast.ucsd.edu/](https://podcast.ucsd.edu/). Beyond that we don't
have any formalized support for auditing the course.


**What if I have enrolled in CSE11 but won't be able to be in La Jolla for most
or all of Fall 2021?**

If the attendance policy above doesn't address your situation, please contact
`jpolitz@eng.ucsd.edu`.

**Do we need a clicker for this class?**

No, we will use other ways (like paper handouts or Google Forms) to keep track
of participation in class.

**Where are the icons from?**
