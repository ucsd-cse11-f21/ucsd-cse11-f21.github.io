There are two main reasons to come see the staff in CSE11.

1. You need help on an assignment, reviewing past work, or understanding something from the course material.
2. An assignment requires or allows you to see a staff member to review your work after you make a submission.

There are two ways to get general help, remotely or in the labs. Checking off
assignment work can _only_ be done remotely over Zoom.

CALENDAR OF REMOTE AND IN PERSON TIMES

## Remote Help

To get help *remotely*, you can join this Zoom room:

Join URL: [https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/95758500952](https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/95758500952)

You will see the waiting room at first when you first visit this Zoom room.
There will be staff in the room at the times above.

When you arrive in the waiting room, there will be a staff member in the main
room who will be admitting students and sending them to breakout rooms for
individual and/or group help based on what you need.

Depending on how many students are present, it may take a few minutes for the
staff member to admit the next group of students, so please be patient!

If you see “waiting for the host to start the meeting” it means that no one is
on right now. Check the calendar above to make sure there are lab hours and
message us on Piazza if someone is supposed to be there and no one is there.

## In-person Help

To get help *in-person*, you can go to the labs in the CSE basement:
