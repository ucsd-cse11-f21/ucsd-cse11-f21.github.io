# Asking Questions, Getting Help, and Meeting the Staff

There are 25 staff members (instructor, TAs, and tutors) to help with your
learning, and a few different ways to get in touch and ask for help.

## Message Board Questions

You can post questions on our Piazza message board at any time: LINK

The message board is a good place for questions about something that was
confusing in class, in videos, in the book, or generally about course content.
It's not always the best place for help with programming details on your
assignments (remote or in-person lab hours are better for that). If you do post
for help with a programming assignment, we ask that you use good judgment in how
much code you share ‚Äì sharing too much as part of your question could harm
others' learning if they aren't expecting to see parts of a solution. 

Feel free to engage with your classmates and help answer their questions. Always
be polite and assume the best intentions. Always assume that the person you're
talking to is asking an honest question, and don't assume they ‚Äúshould know‚Äù
something; if they seem to not know something from the course, reminding them
with a link to where it was taught can be useful (instead of saying something
like ‚Äúthat was already covered‚Äù). Try to guide your classmates to useful
conclusions on their own rather than solving their problems for them. Using
emoji can always help with a positive and friendly vibe üôÇ

During the times where we have take-home programming exams, Piazza will not
allow posting public to the class.

## Meeting with Staff

There are two main reasons to come see the staff in CSE11.

1. You need help on an assignment, reviewing past work, or understanding
something from the course material.
2. An assignment requires or allows you to see a staff member to review your
work after you make a submission.

There are two ways to get general help, remotely or in the labs. Checking off
assignment work can _only_ be done remotely over Zoom.

### Remote Help

To get help *remotely*, you can join this Zoom room: [https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/95758500952](https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/95758500952)

When you arrive in the waiting room, there will be a staff member in the main
room who will be admitting students and sending them to breakout rooms for
individual and/or group help based on what you need.

Depending on how many students are present, it may take a few minutes for the
staff member to admit the next group of students, so please be patient!

If you see ‚Äúwaiting for the host to start the meeting‚Äù it means that no one is
on right now. Check the calendar above to make sure there are lab hours and
message us on Piazza if someone is supposed to be there and no one is there.

### In-person Help

To get help *in-person*, you can go to the labs in the CSE basement:
