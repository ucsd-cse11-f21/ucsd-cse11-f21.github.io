# Accelerated Intro to Programming (UCSD CSE 11) Fall 2021

Greg Miranda (Instructor)
Joe Gibbs Politz (Instructor)

In this course, you will learn to write, trace, and test programs; explore the
interactions between programs and data; and practice organizing programs for
clarity and re-use.

We will explore these topics interactively in lecure, you will implement
programs to practice your programming skills, and you will reflect on this
learning through your own program designs.

This web page serves as the main source of announcements and resources for the
course, as well as the syllabus.

On an average week in CSE11, you can expect to spend 4-6 hours on videos,
reading, lecture, and discussion; 2-3 hours on programming practice; and 4-6
hours working on your programming projects. If you find yourself spending
dramatically more time than this, it's a good idea to contact the course staff
and discuss more efficient strategies in office hours.

<h3>Lecture and Discussion Sections</h3>

Most course content will be presented asynchronously through videos and
readings, with associated interactive activities. Lectures will involve problem
solving with your classmates. Attendance is required at problem-solving lecture
sections; you can either attend your assigned lecture time in person, or attend
one of the discussion sections remotely to get credit.

Recordings of the in-person lectures will be posted later through the UCSD
podcasting system. Since these may be mostly student discussion, these are
mostly an archive of any live demos that come up rather than a presentation of
core content.

## Grading

There are a few components to your grade in the course:

- Lecture attendance (each lecture)
- Completing book exercises and surveys (multiple times per week)
- Programming assignments (weekly)
- Programming exams (3 during quarter + final exam)

Your final letter grade will be calculated as follows:

- To get an A or above, you must:
  - Participate in at least 20 lectures
  - Complete ALL book exercises and course engagement activities
  - Get a score of “complete” on all but 1 programming assignment
  - Get a score of “complete” on all parts of the final exam OR on all of the other programming exams

- To get a B or above, you must:
  - Participate in at least 17 lectures
  - Complete MOST book exercises and course engagement activities
  - Get a score of “complete” on all but 2 programming assignments
  - Get a score of “complete” on all parts of the final exam OR on two of three of the other programming exams

- To get a C or above, you must:
  - Participate in at least 15 lectures
  - Complete MOST book exercises and course engagement activities
  - Get a score of “complete” on at least half of the programming assignments
  - Get a score of “complete” on two of three parts of the final exam OR on two of three of the other programming exams

We may adjust the above scale to be more lenient (depending on a number of
factors that we will not publicize), but we guarantee that we will not adjust
the scale to make it harder to get a better grade. We will not adjust the scale
for individual students. Pluses and minuses will be given at instructors
discretion around the boundaries of these categorizations.

<h3>Engagement</h3>

Each lecture will come with an associated quiz. Completing the quiz before the
next lecture section with at least half of the answers correct gains engagement
credit. You can also get engagement credit by submitting various surveys and
other small engagement tasks we may ask of you throughout the quarter.

You need to get credit for 14 (out of 20 total) quizzes for full engagement
credit.

<h3>Programming</h3>

Most weeks there will be a programming assignment. Direct practice with
programming will make up the majority of your work in the course.

On each assignment, you can earn one of the following scores:

- **2** – the assignment is totally complete with no siginificant
flaws
- **1** – we have identified at least one significant issue with your
assignment that needs to be fixed
- **0** – the assignment is not submitted or not complete enough to
give feedback

<h3>Exams</h3>

In place of on-paper exams, we will follow a different procedure for “exams”
this quarter.

Three times during the quarter and once at the time of the final exam, we will
give you a programming assignment that you must complete in a short time frame
(2-3 days) without any help from other people, including the course staff.  You
can use any resources, notes, readings, and past code from the course to help in
addition to Web-based resources.  Along with submitting the program, you will
record a short video of yourself presenting the program you wrote, demonstrating
its behavior and your understanding. We'll give some opportunities for practice
with this process, and much more detailed instructions with the exam release.

We **do not** expect that the programming work and recording will take three
days of constant work. The tasks will be significantly shorter than the PAs, so
this should only take a few hours. We give the broad range to give you the best
chance to schedule some quiet, focused time to do the work and record the
presentation.

It's worth explaining why we are using this mechanism. There are at least two
reasons:

1. Presenting your code, and demonstrating it via screenshare, is a really
important skill and shows us a lot of your learning. Getting practice with this
style of presentation is a good thing for you to learn in general and a rich
way for us to assess your skills.
2. The main thing that in-person, on-paper exams let us do is easily verify
that it is in fact **you**, the student, completing a major assessment. We can
similarly do so with a video.

## Policies

### Academic Integrity

Individual assignments will describe their academic integrity requirements.
This have a [missive on academic integrity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F6tu-82W5kFkEkZG8n4F7p-MLhyFVWLdPw5Tm1fABfM/edit?folder=1jNMUNlJuyXaOxDE5MdNNfRFARxfP40Rr#)
has some details some examples of what we expect in terms of collaboration in the
course.

Note that with the course remote, one challenge we face as an instructional
team is verifying that students are submitting their own work. We typically use
exams to mitigate this particular challenge to academic integrity, since it
requires an in-person, ID-checked assessment. Assignments and exams will come
with specific policies for what types of collaboration is allowed, but we have
one course-wide policy – we may reach out to students to schedule a check-in on
their understanding of work they've submitted if we're suspicious about an
academic integrity violation. This would involve a videoconference with a TA or
instructor to check that the student has the understanding demonstrated by
their work.

We don't expect to use this option much (certainly **you** are a student that
acts with integrity!), but we state it clearly in the syllabus in case it
becomes necessary so it isn't a surprise to anyone.

You should be familiar with [the UCSD
guidelines](http://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2)
on academic integrity as well.

### Late Work

In general, late work is not accepted. However, most of the categories of
submission for the course allow some missed submissions without having a
large impact on your grade, and you only have to submit a subset of them for
full credit.

### Regrades

Mistakes sometimes occur in grading. Once grades are posted for an assignment,
we will allow a short period for you to request a fix (announced along with
grade release). If you don't make a request in the given period, the grade you
were initially given is final.


### Diversity and Inclusion

We are committed to fostering a learning environment for this course that
supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and respects
your identities (including race, ethnicity, heritage, gender, sex, class,
sexuality, religion, ability, age, educational background, etc.).  Our goal is
to create a diverse and inclusive learning environment where all students feel
comfortable and can thrive.

Our instructional staff will make a concerted effort to be welcoming and
inclusive to the wide diversity of students in this course.  If there is a way
we can make you feel more included please let one of the course staff know,
either in person, via email/discussion board, or even in a note under the door.
Our learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing process,
and we welcome your perspectives and input.

We also expect that you, as a student in this course, will honor and respect
your classmates, abiding by the UCSD Principles of Community
(https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html).  Please understand that others’
backgrounds, perspectives and experiences may be different than your own, and
help us to build an environment where everyone is respected and feels
comfortable.

If you experience any sort of harassment or discrimination, please contact the
instructor as soon as possible.   If you prefer to speak with someone outside
of the course, please contact the Office of Prevention of Harassment and
Discrimination: https://ophd.ucsd.edu/.
